# PHPStaticRender Configuration File
# This file is OPTIONAL - you can delete it if you don't need custom configurations
# The script will work perfectly using default settings defined in phpstaticrender.py
#
# This file allows you to customize the behavior of PHPStaticRender per project
# 
# Requirements to use this file:
# - Python 3.11+: Built-in TOML support
# - Python 3.6-3.10: Install with "pip install toml"

# Replace patterns in generated HTML
# Useful for converting development URLs to production URLs,
# replacing placeholder text, or adjusting paths
[replace]
# Example: Replace localhost URLs with production domain
# "http://localhost" = "https://example.com"
# "http://127.0.0.1" = "https://example.com"

# Example: Replace development paths with production CDN
# "/assets/" = "https://cdn.example.com/assets/"

# Example: Replace placeholder company name
# "COMPANY_NAME_PLACEHOLDER" = "My Company Inc."

# Example: Replace API endpoints
# "http://localhost:8080/api" = "https://api.example.com"

# Add your custom replacements below:
# "search_pattern" = "replacement_text"
